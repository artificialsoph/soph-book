# Hello World

Let's get started learning how to code in python. Before anything else, I want you to learn how to get python to do *something*.


We'll do this by creating a ["Hello World" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), a very simple program that prints the statement "Hello World". This can be done by typing `print("hello world!")` into a code block and then selecting the run button. I've gone ahead and done this, so all you need to do is select "run".

# example below
print("hello world!")

Okay, now it's your turn. I've copied the same cell below but this time, I want you to modify the text between the two quote marks to say something other than "hello world". 

#write your code below

print("hello world!")
