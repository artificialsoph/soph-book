# Hello World

This is just a test.

The first thing we'll learn about python is how we can get it to *do* something that we can then see.

We'll do this by typing `print("hello world!")` into a code block and then selecting the run button. 

In the code cell immediately below, I've gone ahead and done this. All you need to do is select "run".

#write your code below
print("hello world!")

Okay, now it's your turn. I've copied the same cell below but this time, I want you to modify the text between the two quote marks to say something other than "hello world". 

#write your code below
print("hello world!")
